### NOTES

- Modulus operator useful to test is number is even/odd
	- print(NUM % 2)
	- Check if (NUM % 2) == 0
	- 0 means it's even

- Result of division operator '/' is always a floating point number, unless you use '//'
	- print(10/2) = 5.0
	- print(10//2) = 5

- ':' designates block scope?

- block comment is ''' to start/end


### Truthey/Falsey
- Empty string is inherently 'falsey'
	- Can be used with form validation, to check if user submitted empty field
- The number 0 is inherently 'falsey'


### For loop
- Check into 'running sum'
- Updated operator '+='
	- Same as 'total = total + sum'

- 'sum' is reserved word/function
- strings are immutable
